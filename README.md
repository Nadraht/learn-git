# learn-git - Internship Contributing Guide

Intern Contribution Guide

Welcome to the TeamUp LMS Internship Project!
This guide helps interns contribute effectively and maintain a clean collaboration workflow.

1. Creating Your Branch

Always create a new branch for each task.

Use clear naming:

feature/<short-description>
fix/<short-description>
docs/<short-description>


Example: docs/update-readme or feature/add-login-page

2. Making Commits

Write short, descriptive commit messages following this format:

<type>: <what you changed>


Example:

docs: add intern contribution guide

fix: correct dashboard layout issue

3. Opening a Pull Request (PR)

Push your branch to GitHub using:

git push origin <branch-name>


Open a Pull Request (PR) to the main branch.

Add a short PR title and describe your changes clearly.

Tag your reviewer (e.g., @supervisor-name).

Respond politely to review comments and push updates as needed.

4. After Approval

Merge the PR once approved.

Delete your branch (both locally and remotely).

Keep your local main branch updated by pulling regularly:

git checkout main
git pull origin main

5. Professional Collaboration

Communicate respectfully and clearly.

Follow deadlines and update your reviewer if youâ€™re stuck.

Maintain consistent formatting and documentation style.
